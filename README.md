# ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT – PROJECT AUTOMATION

This Project will enhance our appreciation of DevOps tools even more because it will enable us to automate most of the routine tasks with Ansible Configuration Management. At the same time, we will become confident at writing codes using declarative language such as YAML. 
We will develop Ansible scripts to simulate the use of a Jump box/Bastion host to access our Web Servers.


**The workflow below describes how you can automate the deployment process using Jenkins and Ansible, version control your code with GitHub, and deploy to different environments with specific configurations using Ansible's flexibility**



# Set up your environments:
Development Environment: This is where you develop and test your code changes. It typically includes a local machine or a dedicated development server.
# Staging Environment: 
This is a replica of your production environment where you can perform additional testing before deploying changes to production.
Production Environment: This is the live environment where your applications are running and serving end-users.
# Version Control with GitHub:
Create a repository on GitHub to store your codebase.
Clone the repository to your development environment using Git.
Make changes to your code, commit them, and push them back to the repository.
# Configuration Management with Ansible:
Install Ansible on your development environment.
Create an Ansible playbook to define the desired state of your infrastructure and applications.
Configure inventory files to define the target hosts for deployment in different environments (development, staging, production).
Define variables and group variables to manage environment-specific configurations.
# Continuous Integration with Jenkins:
Install and configure Jenkins on a dedicated server or in your development environment. Don’t forget to open port 8080 on the security inbound rules. 
Create a Jenkins job or pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
Configure the Jenkins job to listen for changes in the GitHub repository.
Set up build triggers to automatically trigger the Jenkins job on code commits or pull requests.
